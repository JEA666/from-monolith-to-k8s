# Installing Application Infrastructure with Helm

This section covers how to install Application Infrastructure with Helm and how to connect these components (databases) with our existing Services. 

This approach is recommended for experimenting, development and maybe testing, but you should check [Crossplane](../crossplane/README.md) for production usage in Cloud Providers. This is mostly you will need to maintain these components in the long run, including upgrading versions, backing up data, etc.
