# From Monolith to K8s - Workshop 

During this workshop you will deploy a Cloud-Native application, inspect it and change its configuration to use different services. Plus you'll play around with some Kubernetes and Cloud-Native tools that can help you to be more effective on your cloud journey. 

During this workshop you will be using GKE (Managed Kubernetes Engine inside Google Cloud) to deploy a complex application composed of multiple services. But none of the applications or tools used are tied in any way to Google infrastructure, meaning that you can run these steps in any Kubernetes provider, as well as in an On-Prem Kubernetes installation. 

The main goal is to guide you, step-by-step, to work with an application that will run on a real infrastructure (in contrast to running software on your own laptops). Due the time constraints, the workshop is focused on getting things up and running, but it opens the door for a lot of extensions and experimentation, which we encourage. You can find more instructions to step through under the sections labelled with **Extras**. For beginers and people who want to finish the workshop on time, we recommend leaving the extras for later. We highly encourage you to check the [Next Steps](#next-steps) section at the end of this document if you are interested in going deeper into how this application works, how different tools are being used under the hood and other possible tools that can be integrated.

This workshop is divided into the following sections:
- [Creating accounts and Clusters](#creating-accounts-and-clusters) to run our applications
- [Setting up the Clusters and installing Knative](#checking-kubernetes-cluster-and-installing-knative)
- [Deploying Version 1](#version-1-cloud-native-app) of your Cloud-Native application
- [Deploying Version 2](#version-2-visualize) of your Cloud-Native application, which uses CloudEvents, Knative Eventing and Camunda Cloud for visualization
- [Deploying Version 3](#version-3-workflow-orchestration) of your Cloud-Native application, which uses all of the above but with a focus on orchestration
- [Next Steps](#next-steps)

# Creating accounts and Clusters
During this workshop you will be using a **Kubernetes Cluster** and a **Camunda Cloud Zeebe Cluster** for Microservices orchestration. You need to setup these accounts and create these clusters early on, so they are ready for the remainder of the workshop. 

**Important requisites**
- You need  a Gmail account to be able to participate in the workshop. You will not be using your account for the Google Cloud Platform (GCP), but you need the account to access a free GCP account for QCon.
- You need **Google Chrome** installed on your laptop. We recommend Google Chrome because we've tested this workshop with it and you'll need Incognito Mode too. 
- [Download this ZIP file with resources](https://github.com/salaboy/from-monolith-to-k8s-assets/archive/1.0.0.zip) and Unzip somewhere that you can find it again (like your Desktop)


## Google Cloud account

[Login to Google Cloud by clicking into this link](http://console.cloud.google.com) (if you are a QCon Plus attendee, we will provide you with one, if not you can find other [Kubernetes providers free credits list](https://github.com/learnk8s/free-kubernetes))

### Creating a Kubernetes Cluster

We recommend to use an **Incognito Window** in **Chrome** (File -> New Incognito Window) to run the following steps, as with that you will avoid having issues with your personal **Google Account**

Once you are logged in, you will be asked to accept the terms and continue: 

<img src="workshop-imgs/00-accept-terms-and-continue.png" alt="Terms" width="700px">

Once the terms are accepted, it is **extremely important** that you select the correct project to work on. On the top bar, there is a project dropdown that opens the project list. You need to click into the **QCon SF 2020 ...** project to select it.

<img src="workshop-imgs/01-select-qcon-project.png" alt="Select Project" width="700px">

With the project selected, you can now open **Cloud Shell**

<img src="workshop-imgs/63-google-cloud-home-cloud-shell.png" alt="Cloud Shell" height="700px">

You should see **Cloud Shell** at the bottom half of the screen, notice that you can resize it to make it bigger:

<img src="workshop-imgs/64-cloud-shell-empty.png" alt="Cloud Shell" height="700px">

The first step is to create a cluster to work with. You will create a Kubernetes cluster using **Google Kubernetes Engine**.

Everything on GCP is operated with API (even from the console!). Enable the Google Cloud Platform APIs so that you can create a Kubernetes cluster. 

``` bash
gcloud services enable compute.googleapis.com \
    container.googleapis.com \
    containerregistry.googleapis.com

```

Set the default region and zone for your cluster:

``` bash
gcloud config set compute/zone us-central1-c
gcloud config set compute/region us-central1
```

You can now create a Kubernetes cluster in GCP! Use the Kubernetes Engine to create a cluster:

```
gcloud container clusters create workshop \
      --cluster-version 1.16 \
      --machine-type n2-standard-4 \
      --num-nodes 3 \
      --scopes cloud-platform
```

<img src="workshop-imgs/65-gke-created-in-cloud-shell.png" alt="GKE created in Cloud Shell" width="700px">

This can take a few minutes, so leave the Tab and move forward to **Camunda Cloud Account and Cluster** while the Kubernetes cluster is being created.

If for some reason, you close the browser or you want to see where your Kubernetes clusters are inside GCP you can use the left-hand side menu:


<img src="workshop-imgs/02-go-to-kube-engine.png" alt="GKE created in Cloud Shell" width="400px">

Then use the **Connect** button in the cluster to open the Cluster Details

<img src="workshop-imgs/09-cluster-green.png" alt="GKE created in Cloud Shell" width="700px">

Then use the **Run in Cloud Shell** button to connect

<img src="workshop-imgs/10-connect-to-cluster-with-cloud-shell.png" alt="GKE created in Cloud Shell" width="700px">
  
</details>  


## Camunda Cloud account

[Create a Camunda Cloud Account and Cluster](https://accounts.cloud.camunda.io/signup?campaign=workshop) <- You must to use this link, even if you have another Camunda Cloud Account.

**Fill the form** to create a new account - you will need to use your email to confirm your account creation. You will be using Camunda Cloud for **Microservices Orchestration** ;)  
<img src="workshop-imgs/13-create-camunda-cloud-account.png" alt="Create Camunda Cloud Account" width="700px">

Check your inbox to **activate your account** and follow the links to login, after confirmation:

<img src="workshop-imgs/14-activate-your-account.png" alt="Activate" width="700px">

**Once activated, login with your credentials** and let's create a new **Zeebe cluster**, you will be using this cluster later on in the workshop, but it is better to set it up early on. 

<img src="workshop-imgs/15-create-a-new-zeebe-cluster.png" alt="Create Cluster" width="700px">

**Create a new cluster** called `my-cluster`:

<img src="workshop-imgs/16-call-it-my-cluster.png" alt="My Cluster" width="700px">

Disregard and close this popup if you see it:

<img src="workshop-imgs/17-disregard-creating-model.png" alt="Close popup" width="700px">

Your cluster is now being created:

<img src="workshop-imgs/18-cluster-is-being-created.png" alt="Cluster is being created" width="700px">

Make sure that you have followed the steps in [Setting up your Google Cloud account](#google-cloud-account) and [Setting up your Camunda Cloud account](#camunda-cloud-account), as both of these accounts needs to be ready to proceed to the next section.

**Let's switch back to Google Cloud to setup your Kubernetes cluster, to start deploying your Cloud-Native Applications!** :rocket:

# Checking your Kubernetes cluster and installing Knative

During this workshop, you will be using **Cloud Shell** to interact with your Kubernetes Cluster, this avoids you setting up tools in your local environment and it provides quick access to the cluster resources. 

**Cloud Shell** comes with pre-installed tools like: `kubectl` and `helm`. 

Because you will be using the `kubectl` and `helm` commands a lot during the next couple of hours we recommend you to create the following aliases:

``` bash
alias k=kubectl
alias h=helm
```
Now instead of typing `kubectl` or `helm` you can just type `k` and `h` respectivily. 

You can now type inside Cloud Shell: 
``` bash
k get nodes
```

You should see something like this: 

<img src="workshop-imgs/12-tests-kubectl.png" alt="Cloud Shell" width="1000px">


Next step you will install **Knative Serving** and **Knative Eventing**. 

<img src="workshop-imgs/70-knative-logo.png" alt="Knative" width="300px">

The Cloud-Native applications that you will deploy in later steps were built having Knative in mind. 

**Extras**<details>
  <summary>What and Why Knative?</summary>

[Knative](https://knative.dev/) is a project that provides higher-level abstractions to build robust Cloud-Native applications. Knative is currently split into two main components:
- [Knative Serving](https://knative.dev/docs/serving/): it focuses in simplifying and managing the whole lifecycle of your workloads. This includes routing traffic to your services, handling multiple revisions/versions of your services and how traffic will be routed between these revisions and scaling in a serverless fashion 0 to N replicas with a [Knative Pod Autoscaler](https://knative.dev/docs/serving/autoscaling/). 
- [Knative Eventing](https://knative.dev/docs/eventing/): it provides the primitives to build systems based on producers and consumers of events, allowing late-binding between your components. This means that the abstractions provided by Knative Eventing help us to build decoupled services that can be wired up together for different use cases or to work on different tech stacks and cloud providers. 
    
In general, by using Knative abstractions, you will be able to focus more on building your applications and less dealing with Kubernetes primitives. Knative will help you to rely on abstractions instead of implementations or cloud provider details (as these abstractions supports different implementations). 
For this workshop, I choose to use Knative because it provides a cloud provider agnostic set of abstractions that can be easily installed in any Kubernetes cluster, allowing us to run the applications described here wherever you have a Kubernetes Cluster.
    
</details>

### Installing Knative Serving

If you have the previous aliases set up, you can copy the entire block and paste it Cloud Shell

``` bash
k apply --filename https://github.com/knative/serving/releases/download/v0.18.0/serving-crds.yaml
k apply --filename https://github.com/knative/serving/releases/download/v0.18.0/serving-core.yaml
k apply --filename https://github.com/knative/net-kourier/releases/download/v0.18.0/kourier.yaml
k patch configmap/config-network \
  --namespace knative-serving \
  --type merge \
  --patch '{"data":{"ingress.class":"kourier.ingress.networking.knative.dev"}}'
k apply --filename https://github.com/knative/serving/releases/download/v0.18.0/serving-default-domain.yaml

```

You can check that the installation worked out correctly by checking that all the Knative Serving pods are running:
```bash
k get pods -n knative-serving
```

You should see something like this:

<img src="workshop-imgs/25-knative-serving-test.png" alt="KNative Serving Test" width="1000px">

### Installing Knative Eventing

``` bash
k apply --filename https://github.com/knative/eventing/releases/download/v0.18.0/eventing-crds.yaml
k apply --filename https://github.com/knative/eventing/releases/download/v0.18.0/eventing-core.yaml
k apply --filename https://github.com/knative/eventing/releases/download/v0.18.0/in-memory-channel.yaml
k apply --filename https://github.com/knative/eventing/releases/download/v0.18.0/mt-channel-broker.yaml
k create -f - <<EOF
apiVersion: eventing.knative.dev/v1
kind: Broker
metadata:
 name: default
 namespace: default
EOF

```

You can check that the installation worked out correctly by checking that all the Knative Eventing pods are running:
``` bash
k get pods -n knative-eventing
```

You should see something like this: 

<img src="workshop-imgs/26-knative-eventing-test.png" alt="KNative Eventing Test" width="1000px">

**Important**: if you see Error in the `imc-dispatcher***` pod try copy & pasting the previous `k apply..` commands again and check again. 

Now, **you have everything ready to deploy your Cloud-Native applications to Kubernetes**. :tada: :tada:

# Version 1: Cloud-Native App

In this section you will be deploying a Conference Cloud-Native application composed by 4 simple services. 

<img src="workshop-imgs/microservice-architecture-for-k8s.png" alt="Architecture Diagram" width="700px">

These services communicate between each other using REST calls.

With Knative installed you can proceed to install the first version of the application. You will do this by using [**Helm**](http://helm.sh) a Kuberenetes Package Manager. As with every package manager you need to add a new `Helm Repository` where the **Helm packages/charts** for the workshop are stored. 

You can do this by runnig the following commands: 

``` bash
h repo add workshop http://chartmuseum-jx.35.222.17.41.nip.io
h repo update

```

Now you are ready to install the application by just running the following command:
``` bash
h install fmtok8s workshop/fmtok8s-app

```
You should see something like this (ignore the warnings):

<img src="workshop-imgs/27-helm-repo-add-update-install-v1.png" alt="Helm install" width="1000px">

The application [Helm Chart source code can be found here](https://github.com/salaboy/fmtok8s-app/).

You can check that the application running with the following two commands:

- Check the pods of the running services with: 
``` bash
k get pods
```

- You can also check the Knative Services with: 
```
k get ksvc
```

You should see that pods are being created or they are running and that the Knative Services were created, ready and have an URL:

<img src="workshop-imgs/28-k-getpods-kgetksvc.png" alt="kubectl get pods and ksvcs" width="1000px">

As soon all the pods are running and the services are ready you can copy and paste the `fmtok8s-api-gateway` URL into a different tab in your browser to access the application `http://fmtok8s-api-gateway.default.XXX.xip.io`

<img src="workshop-imgs/agenda-screen.png" alt="Conference Agenda" width="500px">

Now you can go ahead and:
1) Submit a proposal by clicking the Submit Proposal button in the main page

2) Go to the back office (top right link) and Approve or Reject the proposal

<img src="workshop-imgs/backoffice-screen.png" alt="Conference BackOffice" width="500px">

3) Check the email service to see the notification email sent to the potential speaker, this can be done with 
``` bash
k get pods
```
Where you should see the Email Service pod:

<img src="workshop-imgs/59-v1-get-pods-email-highlighted.png" alt="Conference BackOffice" width="1000px">

And then you can tail the logs by running:
``` bash
k logs -f fmtok8s-email-<YOUR POD ID> user-container
```
You should see the service logs being tailed, you can exit/stop taling the logs with `CTRL+C`.

<img src="workshop-imgs/60-email-service-spring-boot-started.png" alt="Conference BackOffice" width="1000px">

And if you **approved** the submitted proposal you should also see something like this: 

<img src="workshop-imgs/61-email-service-tail-logs-approved.png" alt="Conference BackOffice" width="1000px">

4) If you approved the proposal, the proposal should pop up in the Agenda (main page) of the conference. 

<img src="workshop-imgs/62-proposal-in-agenda.png" alt="Conference BackOffice" width="500px">

If you made it this far, **you now have a Cloud-Native application running in a Kubernetes Managed service running in the Cloud!** :tada: :tada:

Let's take a deeper look on what you just did in this section. 

## Understanding your application

In the previous section you installed an application using `Helm`. 

For this example, there is a parent **Helm Chart** that contains the configuration for each of the services that compose the application. 
You can find each service that is going to be deployed inside the `requirements.yaml` file defined [inside the chart here](https://github.com/salaboy/fmtok8s-app/blob/master/charts/fmtok8s-app/requirements.yaml).

This can be extended to add more components if needed, like for example adding application infrastructure components such as Databases, Message Brokers, ElasticSearch, etc. (Example: [ElasticSearch](https://github.com/elastic/helm-charts), [MongoDB](https://artifacthub.io/packages/helm/bitnami/mongodb) and [MySQL](https://artifacthub.io/packages/helm/bitnami/mysql), [Kafka](https://artifacthub.io/packages/helm/bitnami/kafka) charts). 

The configuration for all these services can be found in the [`value.yaml` file here](https://github.com/salaboy/fmtok8s-app/blob/master/charts/fmtok8s-app/values.yaml). This `values.yaml` file can be overriden as well as any of the settings from each specific service when installing the chart, allowing the chart to be flexible enough to be installed with different setups. 

There are a couple of configurations to highlight for this version which are:
- [Knative Deployments are enabled](https://github.com/salaboy/fmtok8s-app/blob/master/charts/fmtok8s-app/values.yaml#L6), each service Helm Chart enable us to define if we want to use a Knative Service or a Deployment + Service + Ingress type of deployment. Because we have Knative installed, and you will be using Knative Eventing later on, we enabled in the chart configuration the Knative Deployment. 
- Because we are using Knative Services a second container (`queue-proxy`) is boostrapped as a side-car to your main container which is hosting the service. This is the reason why you see `2/2` in the `READY` column when you list your pods. This is also the reason why you need to specify `user-container` when you run `k logs POD`, as the logs command needs to know which container inside the pod you want to tail the logs. 
- Both the [`C4P` service](https://github.com/salaboy/fmtok8s-app/blob/master/charts/fmtok8s-app/values.yaml#L16) and the [`API Gateway` service](https://github.com/salaboy/fmtok8s-app/blob/master/charts/fmtok8s-app/values.yaml#L7) need to know where the other services are to be able to send requests. If you are using **Kubernetes Services** instead of **Knative Services** the namin for the services changes a bit. Notice that here for **Knative** we are using `<Service Name>.default.svc.cluster.local`. In this first version of the application `fmtok8s-app` all the interactions between the services happen via REST calls. This push the caller to know the other services names. 


You can open different tabs in **Cloud Shell** to inspect the logs of each service when you are using the application (submitting and approving/rejecting proposals). Remember that you can do that by listing the pods with `k get pods` and then `k logs -f <POD ID> user-container`


## Challenges
This section covers some of the challenges that you might face when working with these kind of applications inside Kubernetes. This section is not needed to continue with the workshop, but it highlight the need for some other tools to be used in conjuction with the application. 

**Extras**<details>
  <summary>To see more details about the challenges (Click to Expand)</summary>

Among some of the challenges that you might face are the following big topics:
- **Flow buried in code and visibility for non-technical users**: for this scenario the `C4P` service is hosting the core business logic on how to handle new proposals. If you need to explain to non-technical people how the flow goes, you will need to dig in the code to be 100% sure about what the application is doing. Non-technical users will never sure about how their applications are working, as they can only have limited visibility of what is going on. How would you solve the visibility challenge? 
- **Edge Cases and Errors**: This simple example, shows what is usually called the **happy path**, where all things goes as expected. In real life implementations, the amount of steps that happens to deal with complex scenarios grows. If you want to cover and have visibility on all possible edge cases and how the organization deals with logical errors that might happen in real life situations, it is key to document and expose this information not only to technical users. How would you document and keep track of every possible edge case and errors that can happen in your distributed applications? How would you do that for a monolith application?
- **Dealing with changes**: for an organization, being able to understand how their applications are working today, compared on how they were working yesterday is vital for communication, in some cases for compliance and of course to make sure that different deparments are in sync. The faster that you want to go with microservices, the more you need to look outside the development departments to apply changes into the production environments. You will need tools to make sure that everyone is in the same page when changes are introduced. How do you deal with changes today in your applications? How do you expose to non-technical users the differences between the current version of your application that is running in production compared with the new one that you want to promote?
- **Implementing Time-Based Actions/Notifications**: I dare to say that about 99% of applications require some kind of notification mechanism that needs to deal with scheduled actions at some point in the future or require to be triggered every X amount of time. When working with distributed system, this is painful, as you will need a distributed scheduler to guarantee that things scheduled to trigger are actually triggered when the time is right. How would you implement these time based behaviours? If you are thinking about **Kubernetes Cron Jobs** that is definitely a wrong answer. 
- **Reporting and Analytics**: if you look at how the services of applications are storing data, you will find out that the structures used are not optimized for reporting or doing analytics. A common approach, is to push the infomration that is relevant to create reports or to do analytics to [ElasticSearch](https://www.elastic.co/elastic-stack) where data can be indexed and structured for efficient querying. Are you using ElasticSearch or a similar solution for building reports or running analytics? 

In version 2 of the application you will be working to make your application's internals more visibile to non-technical users. 

</details> 

You will now undeploy version 1 of the application to deploy version 2. You only need to undeploy version 1 to save resources.
In order to undeploy version 1 of the application you can run:

``` bash
h delete fmtok8s --no-hooks
```
## Questions
This section includes a set of questions for you to experiment and try to answer, we recommend doing this after the live workshop. 
- What happens if you kill a pod from the following services: `fmtok8s-agenda` and/or `fmtok8s-c4p`? how do you solve this problem? 
- What are the main two functionalities provided by the component called `API Gateway`? Why is so important? 
- How and where would you add Single Sign On? 

# Version 2: Visualize 

Version 2 of the application is configured to emit [CloudEvents](http://cloudevents.io), whenever something relevant happens in any of the services. 

For this example, you are interested in the following events: 
- `Proposal Received`
- `Proposal Decision Made`
- `Email Sent`
- In the case of the proposal being approved `Agenda Item Created` 

<img src="workshop-imgs/microservice-architecture-with-events.png" alt="Events" width="400px">


The main goal for Version 2 is to visualize what is happening inside your Cloud-Native appliction from a **Business Perspective**. 
You will achieve that by emitting relevant **CloudEvents** from the backend services to a **Knative Eventing Broker**, which you installed before, that can be used as a router to redirect events to **Camunda Cloud** (an external service that you will use to correlated and monitor these events). 

<img src="workshop-imgs/microservice-architecture-with-ce-zeebe.png" alt="Architecture with CE" width="700px">

Version 2 of the application still uses the same version of the services found in Version 1, but these services are configured to emit events to a **Knative Broker** that was created when you installed Knative. This Knative Broker, receive events and routed them to whoever is interested in them. In order to register interest in certain events, Knative allows you to create **Triggers** (which are like subscriptions with filters) for this events and specify where these events should be sent. 

For Version 2, you will use the **Zeebe Workflow Engine** provisioned in your **Camunda Cloud** account to capture and visualize these meaninful events.
In order to route these **CloudEvents** from the Knative Broker to **Camunda Cloud** a new component is introduced along your Application services. This new component is called **Zeebe CloudEvents Router** and serves as the bridge between Knative and Camunda Cloud, using CloudEvents as the standardize communication protocol. 

As you can imagine, in order for the **Zeebe CloudEvents Router** to connect with your **Camunda Cloud Zeebe Cluster** you need to create a new **Client**, a set of credentials which allows these components to connect and communicate. 

<img src="workshop-imgs/microservice-architecture-with-ce-zeebe-with-router.png" alt="Architecture with CE and Router" width="700px">

Go to the **Camunda Cloud** console, click on your cluster to see your cluster details:

<img src="workshop-imgs/19-cluster-details.png" alt="Cluster Details" width="500px">

Go to the **Clients** tab and then **Create a New Client**:

<img src="workshop-imgs/21-create-cluster-client.png" alt="Cluster Details" width="500px">

Call it `my-client` and click **Add**:

<img src="workshop-imgs/22-call-it-my-client.png" alt="Cluster Details" width="500px">

The new client called `my-client` will be created: 

<img src="workshop-imgs/23-client-created.png" alt="Cluster Details" width="500px">

Now you can access the **Connection Information**:

<img src="workshop-imgs/24-client-information-kube-secret.png" alt="Cluster Details" width="500px">

By clicking the button **Copy Kubernetes Secret** the command will be copied into your clipboard and you can paste it inside **Cloud Shell** inside Google Cloud.

``` bash
k create secret generic camunda-cloud-secret --from-literal=ZEEBE_ADDRESS=...
```

By running the previous command, you have created a new `Kubernetes Secret` that host the credentials for our applications to talk to Camunda Cloud. 
Now you are ready to install version 2 of the application by running (again ignore the warnings): 

``` bash 
h install fmtok8s-v2 workshop/fmtok8s-app-v2
```

<img src="workshop-imgs/29-helm-install-v2.png" alt="Cluster Details" width="700px">

You can check that all the services are up and running with the same two commands as before:

``` bash
k get pods
```

and

``` bash
k get ksvc
```

You should see something like this:

<img src="workshop-imgs/30-k-get-pod-and-ksvc.png" alt="Cluster Details" width="700px">

Notice that now the **Zeebe CloudEvents Router** is running along side the application services, and it is configured to use the Kubernetes Secret that was previously created to connect to **Camunda Cloud**.

But here is still one missing piece to route the **CloudEvents** generated by your application services to the **Zeebe CloudEvents Router** and those are the Knative Triggers (Subscriptions to route the events from the broker to wherever you want). 

These Knative Triggers are defined in YAML and can be packaged inside the Application V2 Helm Chart, which means that they are installed as part of the application. You can find the [triggers definitions here](https://github.com/salaboy/fmtok8s-app-v2/blob/main/charts/fmtok8s-app-v2/templates/ktriggers.yaml). 

You can list these Knative Triggers by running the following command:
``` bash
k get triggers
```

You should see an output like this: 

<img src="workshop-imgs/31-k-get-triggers.png" alt="Cluster Details" width="700px">

Finally, even when **CloudEvents** are being routed to Camunda Cloud, you need to create a model that will consume the events that are coming from the application, so they can be correlated and visualized. 

<img src="workshop-imgs/microservice-architecture-with-ce-zeebe-with-model.png" alt="Cluster Details" width="700px">

You can download the models that you will be using in [the next steps from here](https://github.com/salaboy/from-monolith-to-k8s-assets/archive/1.0.0.zip).

Once you downloaded the models, extract the ZIP file a place that you can quickly locate to upload these files in the next steps. 

Now, go back to your **Camunda Cloud Zeebe Cluster** list (you can do this by clicking in the top breadcrum with the name of your Organization):

<img src="workshop-imgs/32-camunda-cloud-cluster-list.png" alt="Cluster Details" width="700px">

Next, click on the **BPMN Diagrams(beta)** Tab, then click **Create New Diagram**:

<img src="workshop-imgs/33-bpmn-diagrams-list.png" alt="Cluster Details" width="700px">

With the Diagram editor opened, first enter the name **visualize** into the diagram name box and then click the **Import Diagram** button:

<img src="workshop-imgs/34-name-and-import-diagram.png" alt="Cluster Details" width="700px">

Now choose **c4p-visualize.bpmn** from your filesystem: 

<img src="workshop-imgs/35-choose-c4p-visualize-from-filesystem.png" alt="Cluster Details" width="700px">

The diagram shoud look like:

<img src="workshop-imgs/36-diagram-1-should-look-like.png" alt="Cluster Details" width="700px">

With the Diagram ready, you can now hit **Save and Deploy**:

<img src="workshop-imgs/37-save-and-deploy.png" alt="Cluster Details" width="700px">

Next, **close/disregard** the popup suggesting to start a new instance:

<img src="workshop-imgs/38-close-popup.png" alt="Cluster Details" width="700px">

Well Done! you made it, now everything is setup for routing and fowarding events from our application, to Knative Eventing, to the Zeebe CloudEvents Router to Camunda Cloud. 

In order to see how this is actually working you can use **Camunda Operate**, a dashboard included inside **Camunda Cloud** which allows you to understand how these models are being executed, where things are at a giving time and to troubleshoot errors that might arise from your applications daily operations.

You can access **Camunda Operate** from your cluster details, inside the **Overview Tab**, at the bottom, clicking in the **View in Operate** link:

<img src="workshop-imgs/39-cluster-details-operate-link.png" alt="Cluster Details" width="700px">

You should see the **Camunda Operate** main screen, where you can click in the **C4P Visualize** section highlighted in the screenshot below:

<img src="workshop-imgs/40-operate-main-screen.png" alt="Cluster Details" width="700px">

This opens the runtime data associated with our workflow models, now you should see this:

<img src="workshop-imgs/41-visualize-diagram-in-operate.png" alt="Cluster Details" width="700px">

Now go back to the Conference Application, remember, listing all the Knative Services will show the URL for the API Gateway Service that is hosting the User Interface, when you are in the application, submit a new proposal and then refresh **Camunda Operate**:

<img src="workshop-imgs/42-runtime-data-in-operate.png" alt="Cluster Details" width="700px">

If you click into the Instance ID link, highligted above, you can see the details of that specific instance:

<img src="workshop-imgs/43-instance-data.png" alt="Cluster Details" width="700px">

If you go ahead to the **Back Office** of the application and **approve** the proposal that you just submitted, you should see in **Camunda Operate** that the instance is completed:

<img src="workshop-imgs/44-approved-instance.png" alt="Cluster Details" width="700px">

<details>
  <summary>**Extras**: Understanding different branches (Click to Expand)</summary>
As you might notice, the previous workflow model will only work if you approve proposals, as the `Agenda Item Created` event is only emitted if the proposal is accepted. In order to cover also the case when you reject a proposal you can deploy version 2 of the workflow model, that describes these two branches for approving and rejecting proposals.
  
In order to deploy the second version of the workflow model you follow the same steps as before  
  
<img src="workshop-imgs/45-bpmn-diagrams-list-with-v1.png" alt="Cluster Details" width="700px">

Click into your previously saved diagram called **visualize** and then **Import Diagram** and then select **cp4-visualize-with-branches.bpmn**:

<img src="workshop-imgs/46-c4p-visualize-v2.png" alt="Cluster Details" width="700px">

The new diagram should like this:

<img src="workshop-imgs/47-c4p-vizualize-diagram.png" alt="Cluster Details" width="700px">

Now you are ready to **Save and Deploy** the new version:

<img src="workshop-imgs/48-save-and-deploy-v2.png" alt="Cluster Details" width="700px">

If you switch back to **Camunda Operate** you will now see two versions of the **C4P Visualize** workflow:

<img src="workshop-imgs/49-camunda-operate-two-versions.png" alt="Cluster Details" width="700px">

Click to drill down into the runtime data for the new version of the workflow:

<img src="workshop-imgs/50-new-version-deployed.png" alt="Cluster Details" width="700px">

If you now go back to the application and submit two proposals you can reject one and approve one, you should now see both instances completed:

<img src="workshop-imgs/51-version-2-completed.png" alt="Cluster Details" width="700px">

Remember that you can click in any instance to find more details about the execution, such as the audit logs to understand exactly when things happened:

<img src="workshop-imgs/52-audit-log.png" alt="Cluster Details" width="700px">

</details>

If you made it this far, **you can now observe your Cloud-Native applications by emitting CloudEvents from your services and consuming them from Camunda Cloud**. :tada: :tada:

Let's undeploy version 2 to make some space for version 3. 

```
h delete fmtok8s-v2 --no-hooks
```

# Version 3: Workflow Orchestration

In Version 3, you will orchestrate the services interactions using the workflow engine. 

<img src="workshop-imgs/microservice-architecture-orchestration.png" alt="Architecture Diagram" width="700px">

You can now install version 3 running:

``` bash
h install fmtok8s-v3 workshop/fmtok8s-app-v3
```
The ouput for this command should look familiar at this stage:

<img src="workshop-imgs/53-installing-v3.png" alt="Cluster Details" width="700px">

Check that the Kubernetes Pods and the Knative Services are ready:

<img src="workshop-imgs/54-checking-pods-ksvc-v3.png" alt="Cluster Details" width="700px">

When all the pods are ready (2/2) you can now access to the application. 

As you might have noticed, there is a new Knative Service and pod called **fmtok8s-speakers**, you will use that service later on.  

An important change in version 3 is that it doesn't use a REST based communication between services, this version let **[Zeebe](http://zeebe.io)**, the workflow engine inside **Camunda Cloud**, to define the sequence and orchestrate the services interactions. **[Zeebe](http://zeebe.io)** uses a Pub/Sub mechanism to communicate with each service, which introduces automatic retries in case of failure and reporting incidents when there are service failures. 

**Extras**<details>
  <summary>Changes required to let Zeebe communicate with our existing services (Click to Expand)</summary>
@TODO: Add Links to Workers, and dependencies in projects, plus explain how the workers code is reusing the same code as rest endpoints internally. 
</details>

Another important change, is that the **C4P Service** now deploys automatically the workflow model used for the orchestration to happen. 
This means that when the **fmtok8s-c4p** Knative Service is up and ready, you should have a new workflow model already deployed in **Camunda Cloud**:

<img src="workshop-imgs/55-new-workflow-model-in-v3.png" alt="Cluster Details" width="700px">

If you now click into the new workflow model you can see how the new model looks like: 

<img src="workshop-imgs/56-v3-orchestration-workflow-model.png" alt="Cluster Details" width="700px">

If you submit a **new proposal** from the application user interface, this new workflow model is in charge of defining the order in which services are invoked. 
From the end user point of view, nothing has changed, besides the fact that they can now use **Camunda Operate** to understand in which step each proposal is at a given time. From the code perspective, the business logic required to define the steps is now delegated to the workflow engine, which enables non-technical people to gather valuable data about how the organization is working, where the bottlenecks are and how are your Cloud-Native applications working. 

Having in a single place the state of all proposals can help organizers to prioritize other work or just make decisions to move things forward:

<img src="workshop-imgs/57-quick-overview-of-state.png" alt="Cluster Details" width="700px">

In the screenshot above, it is clear that 2 proposals are still waiting for a decision, 2 proposals were approved and 1 rejected. 
Remember that you can drill down to each individual workflow instance for more details, for example, how much time a proposal has been waiting for a decision:

<img src="workshop-imgs/58-waiting-for-decision.png" alt="Cluster Details" width="700px">

Based on the data that the workflow engine is collecting from the workflow's executions, you can understand better where the bottlenecks are or if there are simple things that can be done to improve how the organization is dealing with proposals. For this example, you can say that this workflow model represent 100% the steps required to accept or reject a proposal, in some way this explains to non-technical people the steps that the application is executing under the covers. 

Becuase the workflow model is now in charge of the sequence of interactions, you are free to change and adapt the workflow model to better suit your organization needs. 

If you made it this far, **Well Done!!! you have now orchestrated your microservices interactions using a workflow engine!** :tada: :tada:

# Next Steps

There are tons of options and challenges to solve in the Cloud-Native space, you can use this workshop and applications as a playground to test new projects before adopting them for your applications. That is exactly the reason why these apps were built in such way. Here are some recommendations for futher exploring, improvements that can lead to contributions to these repositories for future workshops or just to serve as examples for the entire Kubernetes community:

- [Jenkins X](http://jenkins-x.io) &  [Tekton](http://tekton.dev): These applications and services were built using Jenkins X which provides CI/CD for Kubernetes and it uses [Tekton](http://tekton.dev) as the underlying pipeline engine. Both of these projects, Tekton and Jenkins X do and implement their own tools in a Kubernetes Native way (meaning that they follow kubernetes best practices and tap into the Kubernetes ecosystem to design and implement their own components). I strongly recommend you to check both of these projects, if you are planning to build, maintain and deploy multiple services in Kubernetes.

- [External Secrets](https://github.com/external-secrets/kubernetes-external-secrets): External Secrets created by GoDaddy, provides a set of abstractions similarly to Knative to deal with Secrets Management in a Cloud Agnostic way. Configuring the Camunda Cloud Secrets directly in Google Cloud Secrets Manager would be a cleaner and more real solution. You can explore how External Secrets work and how adding External Secrets to this projects would work. 

- [CloudEvents Orchestration](https://github.com/salaboy/orchestrating-cloud-events): an extension to this workshop, using a different application goes further into Orchestrating Cloud Events with the Zeebe Workflow Engine. On this example, you can explore how the Workflow Engine can also produce Cloud Events, avoiding your Services and Applications knowing anything about the fact that they are being orchestrated (no dependencies added to your services, they will just emit and consume CloudEvents). This example also covers the use of WebSockets to forward CloudEvents to the Client Side (browser).


- **Kafka as Knative Eventing Channel Provider**: Leveraging the power of the Knative Eventing abstractions, you can swap the Eventing Channel provider by Kafka, for a more realistic and robust tech stack and the application will just work. Notice that the application as it is configured here, uses an InMemory provider which is good only for development purposes. For installing [Kafka you might want to use the Helm Chart located here](https://bitnami.com/stack/kafka/helm) to follow the same approach that we are using for the application itself. 

- **Google Pub/Sub as Knative Eventing Channel Provider**: If you are running in Google Cloud, why maintaining a Kafka installation if you can leverage the power of Google Pub/Sub. In theory, and in the same way as with Kafka, you should be able to just replace the Channel implementation and your application should work without any changes. 

- **Adding Single Sign-On**: Looking at projects like [Dex](https://github.com/dexidp/dex), how would you deal with SSO and **Identity management** for your applications? What changes do you need to implement in each service? How would you configure the API Gateway to redirect requests that requires authentication? This tends to be such a common requirement, that adding Single Sign On to this example, migth be an excelent conttribution for someone who wants to learn in the process.
