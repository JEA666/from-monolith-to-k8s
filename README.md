# From Monolith to K8s

Welcome to this community project created to be used as examples for showing different Open Source projects that can help you in your Cloud-Native journey. 

No matter which technology stack  you are using for your day to do day work, these examples are easy to follow and should give enough pointers for you to implement similar approaches in your projects. 

This repository contains different directories that explains different aspects of the sample application and how different projects can be used in conjuctions to solve particular challenges or to make our everyday life a little bit easier. 

# Scenario

The examples included and linked in this repository all use the same application, a Conference Platform. You can find more about the application and the application architecture in the [scenario section](scenario.md)


# Open Source Projects 

After installing playing around and trying to break the application you can try to use different Open Source projects to solve different challenges, and you can find separate guides to do so: 
- [Using Helm as a Package Manager](helm/README.md)
- [Building your Services with Tekton](tekton/README.md)
- [Canary Releases with Knative Serving](knative/README.md)
- [Event-Driven Architectures with Knative Eventing](knative/README.md)
- [Single Sign-On with Keycloak](sso/README.md)
- [Monitoring with Prometheus and Graphana](monitoring/README.md)
