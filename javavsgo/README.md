# Java vs Go 

This directory contains some very simple example projects using libraries in both languages. 
The context of this comparision is highly related to the `kubernetes-controllers` directory. 
The aim is to compare ecosystems and not languages, as with containers, we now live in a polyglot world. 

Let's start with Java and then move into a more detailed look into Go. 

In 2022, it just don't make any sense to start with plain Java, hence you will be looking probably into Spring Boot. Quarkus is included here too as its a newer framework that inherits the way of working with Java EE applications for the the Cloud Native era. 

For Spring Boot, Quarkus and Go we will look at frameworks and tools available to create basic functionality as well as a web server to expose REST endpoints. 
We will be also looking at dependency management and how they compare from an ecosystem point of view. 

## Spring Boot


## Quarkus


## Go

In `go` will evaluate


## Kubernetes

In this section we will be looking at how these frameworks in different languages integrate with Docker & Kubernetes and also the frameworks that we can use to interact with the Kubernetes API server.
